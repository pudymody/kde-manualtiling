<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a Kwin Script to tile windows by clicking in a grid. For now, its a [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/) clone from Mac Osx in KDE.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This was tested in the following settings. If you try it in another and it works, let me know so i can put it here.

* Plasma 5.24.4
* KDE Frameworks 5.92.0
* Qt 5.15.3


### Installation

1. Download the release file
2. Load it from *System Settings -> Window Management -> KWin Scripts -> Install from file*
3. You could change the number of columns, rows, colors and more from the settings.
4. The default shortcut is *Meta+Ctrl+D*. If you dont like it, you could change it from *System Setggins -> Shortcuts -> Kwin -> Manual Tiling*

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Press the assigned shortcut and a grid with the focused title will be shown. Click on a grid square, then on another, and the window will be resized to fit that space.
